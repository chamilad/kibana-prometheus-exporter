# Prometheus Exporter for Kibana (7.10.*)

A standalone Prometheus exporter for Kibana metrics inspired by the [Kibana Prometheus Exporter Plugin](https://github.com/pjhampton/kibana-prometheus-exporter/). 

This makes use of the `/api/status` endpoint to gather and convert metrics to the Prometheus OpenMetrics format.

The source files are found at the [GitHub repository chamilad/kibana-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/chamilad/kibana-prometheus-exporter).

## Metrics
The metrics exposed by this Exporter are the following.

| Metric | Description | Type |
|------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `kibana_status` | Kibana overall status | Gauge |
| `kibana_concurrent_connections` | Kibana Concurrent Connections | Gauge |
| `kibana_millis_uptime` | Kibana uptime in milliseconds | Gauge |
| `kibana_heap_max_in_bytes` | Kibana Heap maximum in bytes | Gauge |
| `kibana_heap_used_in_bytes` | Kibana Heap usage in bytes | Gauge |
| `kibana_os_load_1m` | Kibana load average 1m | Gauge |
| `kibana_os_load_5m` | Kibana load average 5m | Gauge |
| `kibana_os_load_15m` | Kibana load average 15m | Gauge |
| `kibana_response_average` | Kibana average response time in milliseconds | Gauge |
| `kibana_response_max` | Kibana maximum response time in milliseconds | Gauge |
| `kibana_requests_disconnects` | Kibana request disconnections count | Gauge |
| `kibana_requests_total` | Kibana total request count | Gauge |


## Usage
The Docker Image can be used directly to run the exporter in a Dockerized environment. The Container filesystem only contains the statically linked binary, so that it can be run independently.

> **NOTE**: Currently tested against below Kibana versions only.
> 1. 7.5
> 2. 7.8
> 3. 7.10
>
> Please open an issue if you see errors or missing metrics with the Kibana version you're using.
>
> Match the Kibana version with the release tag (ex: release `v7.5.x.2` will work with Kibana `7.5.x` versions. It's possible it will continue to work for a few more minor releases, but this depends on what Elastic decides to do with the idea of semantic versioning)
>
> First 3 sections of the release tag represents the Kibana version compatibility, while the last section indicates patching increments.


```bash
# expose metrics from the local Kibana instance using the provided username and password
docker run -p 9684:9684 -it chamilad/kibana-prometheus-exporter:v7.10.x.1 -kibana.uri http://localhost:5601 -kibana.username elastic -kibana.password password
```

```bash
# expose metrics using /scrape endpint
docker run -p 9684:9684 -it chamilad/kibana-prometheus-exporter:v7.10.x.1 -kibana.uri http://localhost:5601 -web.telemetry-path "/scrape"
```

### Kubernetes
Refer the artifacts in [`k8s`](k8s) directory. There is a Deployment and a Service that exposes the Deployment. 

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/kibana-prometheus-exporter.yaml
```

```bash
$  kubectl get all -l app=kibana-prometheus-exporter
  NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  pod/kibana-prometheus-exporter-b8c888bcd-66kvx   1/1     Running   0          16s
  
  NAME                                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
  service/kibana-prometheus-exporter   ClusterIP   10.96.252.18   <none>        9684/TCP   16s
  
  NAME                                         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  deployment.apps/kibana-prometheus-exporter   1/1     1            1           16s
  
  NAME                                                   DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
  replicaset.apps/kibana-prometheus-exporter-b8c888bcd   1         1         1       16s
```

With these artifacts deployed, the following Prometheus scrape configuration can be used to scrape the metrics.

```yaml
    - job_name: "kibana"
      scrape_interval: 1m
      metrics_path: "/metrics"
      kubernetes_sd_configs:
        - role: service
      relabel_configs:
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_label_app]
          regex: "kibana-exporter"
          action: keep
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
          action: replace
          target_label: kubernetes_namespace
        - source_labels: [__address__, __meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_prometheus_io_port]
          target_label: __address__
          regex: ([^:]+)(?::\d+)?;(\d+)
          replacement: $1:$2
```

##### Things to note about the Prometheus Scrape Config
 
1. The `scrape_interval` for the job is kept to once per minute. This is to reduce the load on the ElasticSearch cluster, by frequent API calls.
2. The port to connect is detected through a K8s Service annotation, `prometheus.io/port`. 
3. The metrics will end up with the label `job: kibana`
